# Outlier detection

The objective is to implement an outlier detection strategy.

## RNN

RNN (replicator neural network) : the input variables are also the output variables so
that the RNN forms an implicit, compressed model of the data during training. The RNN approach has linear analogues in
Principal Components Analysis. 

The work is based on the paper "Outlier Detection Using Replicator Neural Network" Simon Hawkins, Hongxing He, Graham Williams and Rohan Baxter
